### Google Forms/Sheets

The simplest option is to **fill out this Google Form: [LINK TO FORM](https://forms.gle/7XwP854e5ymDgcyKA)** (No google account needed)

Responses to the form are all [in this Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1t9zLFF-ieEoPdq2OI7kEvUuubqA8_1_dAy2TDxdJoo0/edit?usp=sharing) but they aren't automatically added to this page - I have to do that manually.

### GitHub

Alternatively, if you have a (free) GitHub account, you can also:

* [Create an issue](https://github.com/thanksforlistening/subaru-vip/issues/new?assignees=thanksforlistening&labels=&template=add-or-update-dealership-information.md&title=Update+dealer+information) with a note on what should be updated
* OR fork/clone this repo, update the chart yourself, and [make a pull request](https://github.com/thanksforlistening/subaru-vip/compare)

Check other [open issues](https://github.com/thanksforlistening/subaru-vip/issues) or [pull requests](https://github.com/thanksforlistening/subaru-vip/pulls) before adding your own to make sure someone else hasn't already requested this same change.

## More info

### What is the VIP program?

Various organizations have negotiated agreements with Subaru of America to give discounts to employees and members 

Currently, the most common discounted rate seems to be invoice price, but previous discounts have been 2% under invoice. This also depends on the organization.

I'm not going to list all the ways you can get VIP pricing here.

### Disclaimers

This list is based on unconfirmed reports from the public. Confirm with the dealer before proceeding.
